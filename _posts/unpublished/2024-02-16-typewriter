WHY DO ALL KEYBOARDS LOOK LIKE THAT?

Hello, today we take a look at the origin of the modern keyboard

Have you ever wondered why all keyboard looks and functions they way they are

Why don’t they start with ABCD, which is more intuitive, instead of QWERTY, which makes no sense

And why are some of the keys named that? Why Shift and not Capitalize, and why return not Goes down 1 line and back, why TAB??    
What is the meaning and functions of all of these, coming up

The first keyboards:

-	The original typewriters’ keyboards did not look like this at all, in fact, they all looked like pianos, and they all had problems
-	This one you couldn’t see what you’re typing (insert a joke about a guy typing something totally fine just to mistype it into something vulgar without knowing it)
-	This one is well, not good.
-	This one is too complicated

But a genius guy in Milwaukee (USA) came up with a machine that solved most of these problems,     
mostly because he kept sending his prototypes to be destroyed by a tester until he could build one that didn’t break when people start hitting it violently

This genius guy is called Christopher Latham Sholes,

To this day, nobody really knows why he arranges his keyboard the QWERTY way, some say that its so the keys 
that often typed together don’t get jam, the French, meanwhile, just decided to make it AZERTY for no reason (aw, magnifique!)

## Which brings me to the most exciting part of this episode, how does a keyboard on a typewriter work?

As you can seen, they don’t look too much different from keyboard nowadays

The letters arrangement is the same, the space bar moves things 1 space forward, 

the return button is actually this lever which is called the return lever that you slide to goes back to the start of the line, then you push slightly and it goes down 1 line, neat

there was no delete button, but there was a backspace so you can go back and put a dash over the incorrect letters, and that’s why Microsoft still calls it backspace while Apple did the right thing and changed it to mean delete in modern keyboard

now comes my favorite key, the Shift, it is called Shift because you hit it and it mechanically Shift the whole carriage up, which lines up the ink with the capital letters on the typebars instead of the normal letters. 

You can even keep the carriage up by pressing this key here, and it locks the carriage in the up position, which by now I think you can guess why its called Caps Lock

The Shift function is also the reason why keys with 2 letters are designed like that, with the letters, at the lower half, being produced by hitting once, while if you SHIFT the carriage up, the upper half letter will be produced. It works the same way with modern keyboard, now you don’t have to pause before typing =+

Tab key

On typewriters, the tab key moved the carriage to a fixed horizontal position, marked with a tab stop. This allowed typists to create columns of text or numbers, also known as tabular layouts (hence the name tab).

1	1
2	2
3	3

So why does the QWERTY keyboard stick around?

It's all due to inertia, Sholes needed a manufacturer, and he came to the largest manufacturer of guns at the time, Remington, who was already fed up with producing 
sewing machine, so they need a new toy to make. 

So they make Sholes' design into a sewing machine shape, the first mass produced typewriter. 

Other manufacturers start to get on the train and soon enough, everyone was making typewriters, some study reported ==thousands of typewriting== machines were made
a day.

Typewriters were used through the first and second world war and up until the 60s, some of the best works of human are produced by the typewriters:
- mario puzo's the godfather


**need research** 
when personal computers were invented, the typewriters are not efficient enough to stay in the game. By the 1980s, it had virtually been ousted by the PC. But its legacy hasn't.
The manufacturers of PC debated over using a different kind of keyboard for the PC, but that would have required dedicated retraining of millions of people around the world who
has already been familiar with the QWERTY, such as secretary and the writers. 
So after all, they keep the same design with some tweaks for modern computers, adding functions using COMMAND and CONTROL buttons, the arrows
