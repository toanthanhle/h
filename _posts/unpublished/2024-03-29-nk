Hôm nay tôi lại thấy sợ con bé đó. Tại sao tôi lại sợ nó đến thế. Tại vì tôi sợ nó nghĩ rằng tôi không đủ khả năng để dạy nó.

Tôi thì đã cạn kiệt sức để mà muốn dạy. Tôi chỉ mong công việc này vì nó pays the bills.
And I wanna keep this job until I can leave it at the beginning of June.

I am not quite excited for this new job at EXPLO camp since I won't be able to go on
trips as I am managing it. 

I am quite spent these days. Between finishing my Fulbright essays and completing final
huddles for the US summer program's application, I have had barely any rest or time for
myself.

I can still squeeze in some workout time and that has been a great boost to my energy and well-being. 

I need to allocate time for researching my itinerary, what should I pack, what gifts should I buy, how would I make the most of it.
