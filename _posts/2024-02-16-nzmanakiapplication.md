## My goal
- is to make learning fun and accessible for as many people as possible.
- I believe that people should have access to knowledge that they want to learn, should be able to learn from the best, improve their lives and their knowledge, no matter the circumstances of their finance and their living conditions. 
- I believe in learning the essential skills in a fun and meaningful way. 

## What knowledge and skills do you expect to learn from your proposed program of study?
Can this program of study provide you with your desired knowledge and skills? 

## Why are these knowledge and skills important to your country's development?

Because Vietnam has this problem, in order for it to be solved and for my country to develop in this respect, these knowledge, skills and my experience can help solve it!

For two reasons, the first is the lack of high-quality efforts that are being implemented in the digital transformation at schools across levels in Vietnam. It is reported that most University and schools in VN is still not fully transitioning to digital learning and teaching due to the lack of MOOCs, LMS system and staff specilizing in interactive lectures **ref**

also lack of human resources to apply digital technology in the educational settings:

This problem is not due to the lack of technology adoption since study has shown that most Vietnamese own a smartphone **ref** 
> https://english.mic.gov.vn/Pages/TinTuc/tinchitiet.aspx?tintucid=153538, 
in rural area, this figure is still impressive with almost 70% (2019) own a smartphone **ref**

and most Vietnamese have access to internet (79%), above Mexico and China **ref**

and also one of the fastest growing digital economy **ref**

yet, their digital transformation in education and high-quality effort in digital education is lagging behind
- digital transformation skills is lowest in the region

- quality control is pragmatic and disorganized **ref** (p11)
> https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/824536/adbi-case-study-2022-no-3-viet-nam-final-proof.pdf 

making learning outcomes lag behind too **ref**

Reason number 2 is that digital transformation could be the key to solve the educational quality imbalance between urban and remote areas in Vietnam. **ref** It is estimated that students in the mountainous area are less likely   
to have quality teachers and materials. 

This could be solved by a careful design of digital course, even surpass the traditional ones, since learning at home has more benefits such as flexible time, access to more materials, but it's important that teachers are trained well and that course are designed well **ref**

some results are being reported as children are more engaged with digital-enhanced materials **ref**

In order for this digital transformation in education to really prove fruitful, Vietnam will need these knowledge and skills

## How will you use your new knowledge and skills to contribute to the development of your home country?

These are the realistic ways I will apply my knowledge and skills to solve the problem I mentioned above, based  
on my capability and aspiration. What knowledge and skills that I learn from the course will I apply to solve the problems mentioned above? What kind of experience or skills that I proved in the past that can kinda guarantee   
that I can do so in the future?
- I've worked with a lot of schools on their needs and their students' needs and provide them with tailored program, most of them are international schools with high standards, 

There are two things that I will do
1. At the organizational level, the first thing is to join an influential university as digital education expert to help implement the transition. Combined with knowledge learned from the course and the skills of working with a variety of stakeholders, I aim to become agent of change and contribute to this process. This will set an example for other universities that are still hesitant.
2. At societal level, the second thing would be to carry out digital education tools training that target digital education adoption in remote area, these can be done by campaign that target teachers of mountainous areas, particularly ones where internet adoption are higher. Knowledge and exposure from a diverse culture where many cultures meet like NZ would be vital to adapt this process to a place like Vietnam, where mountainous areas are mostly consist of different ethnic groups.

With my knowledge and certification from Google and Apple, which are adopted by most people in Vietnam, plus the learning experience design, I can facilitate this process. 

## Relationship

### Describe a situation that demonstrates your ability to develop new relationships that have been important for your work or study

- Describe the situation

- What actions did you take to develop the relationship?

- What was the outcome?

## Motivate yourself
- Situation: I wanted to become the first Vietnamese Camp Director at my company, GPA. My title, however, was not exactly related to that, I was a program logistics manager. I knew that being a Camp Director was what I wanted to do. I enjoyed seeing kids face light up with a cool activity, researching and creating the events, 
- Actions:
    - Even though I was a senior, I volunteered to work as intern-level counselor to learn the rope. This would help me understand the ins and outs of working directly with kids. I wanted to understand every aspect of doing camps. Then came 

- Outcomes:
    - The first two years were especially hard, there wasn't many opportunities to exercise the job of a camp director. Therefore, I had to break down the individual role of a camp director and found myself a chance to excercise them. 
    - Eventually, an opportunity opens up when I least expected it, the pandemic was in full swing and because not many foreigners can come to Vietnam, a Camp Director position opened up, and I made a proposal to become a shared Director for that camp.
    First camp was especially hard, I needed to adapt to the change, I needed to manage a lot more people, I had to be on almost every minute of the working day, even late until the night to manage students' problem.

    There was one occassion where I got 2 kids fainted in the middle of the night, it turned out the first girl was just having her first period and she felt terrible, the boy fainted in the most dramatic way, we had to keep him awake for the most of the night, this camp was in the middle of nowhere too
    Another occasion was when one girl in the event that I was in charge of got hit by a basketball hoop structure and has to rushed to the hospital, luckily, she was not seriously harmed, even though she lost 2 of his front teeth due to the accident
    Another incident was when

I have always wanted to become someone who is really good at helping people learn, in the most interesting and efficient way possible. This was how I managed to do that. However, I always feel like something is missing. It was the science behind how people learn things. In order to make learning both interesting and efficient, I needed to ultilize what science know about how people learn, what are the approaches to creating effective materials that ultilize different modalities. And when faced with new learning wave, can think critically and know the scientific way to experiment with new learning methods. 

In the end, I wanted to prove that I got enough knowledge of the field that it wasn't just a whim. I got some success. I can motivate myself and achieve great outcomes. However, without this academic deep dive, I wouldn't be able to move up further. Because only after I got the knowledge from this, I would be able to achieve my goal, which is becoming an Instructional Designer. And here is my 5, 10, 15 years plan.

How do I make it easy for people to accept whatever I wanted to propose. To satisfy and exceed their requirements.

I wanted to create cool activities that would have the audience go wow, that would have to wholeheartedly engaged in and with others, that in the end, they would have learned a lesson or two for themselves through not by just absorbing information, but actively excercising and building up to the outcomes.
