"What is your ideal woman?" - My date asked me. I was sipping on the cocktails, spirting out    
the answers without even thinking   
"Oh Mrs. Ha, she is my 5th grade teacher"   
She immemdiately raised her eyebrows, with a more serious voice, she has switched to a more    
reserved manner. I can sense that she has misunderstood my intention, she must have thought    
I was one of those people who is like "My teacher is my lover"    
"Oh don't get me wrong, I don't mean romantically, but that she was the biggest reason why    
I chose to be an educator"

Mrs. Ha came to class that spring day of 2005 with a bag of props and costumes and a surprise for    
otherwise would be a normal lesson of History. We were surprised but   
intrigued, usually, we would just recite the prose and try to remember whatever has been   
shown in the textbook. She, on the other hand, did something that I had never seen before. She would   
have us act out the stories. I was so excited that I volunteered to be the main character, usually I   
would be the shyest guy. I still remember a scene where my character, Pham Ngu Lao, a general of the    
Quang Trung dynasty, then-unknown, sitting in the middle of the road blocking the then general Tran    
Hung Dao only to be stabbed in the thigh, but he didn't move. I made a slight artistic alteration   
and add an comment, in English and everyone in my class laughed. I didn't know then, but I credit that   
moment for my purpose of making learning fun.
