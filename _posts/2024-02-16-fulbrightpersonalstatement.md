"What is your ideal woman?" - My date asked me. I was sipping on the cocktails, spirting out    
the answers without even thinking   
"Oh Mrs. Ha, she is my 5th grade teacher"   
She immemdiately raised her eyebrows, with a more serious voice, she has switched to a more    
reserved manner. I can sense that she has misunderstood my intention, she must have thought    
I was one of those people who is like "My teacher is my lover"    
"Oh don't get me wrong, I don't mean romantically, but that she was the biggest reason why    
I chose to be an educator"

Mrs. Ha came to class that spring day of 2005 with a bag of props and costumes and a surprise for    
otherwise would be a normal lesson of History. We were surprised but   
intrigued, usually, we would just recite the prose and try to remember whatever has been   
shown in the textbook. She, on the other hand, did something that I had never seen before. She would   
have us act out the stories. I was so excited that I volunteered to be the main character, usually I   
would be the shyest guy. I still remember a scene where my character, Pham Ngu Lao, a general of the    
Quang Trung dynasty, then-unknown, sitting in the middle of the road blocking the then general Tran    
Hung Dao only to be stabbed in the thigh, but he didn't move. I made a slight artistic alteration   
and add an comment, in English and everyone in my class laughed. I didn't know then, but I credit that   
moment for my purpose of making learning fun.

It should be a welcome to MY life

Have a consistent theme
For example, strive to achieve excellence throughout the career
- For me, it's making learning fun and meaningful.
- What could be the other two?
    - How I learned to be a team player
    - Tenacity (endurance)
    - Passion <- what are some examples of this

Todo
1. Draw conclusions about the value of your past experiences.
2. Help them pick you as an interviewee.
3. Inspire faith that you can stuck to your gun, can strive and will succeed.

    “Fun doesn’t always equal learning. One of the reasons why gamification has failed in some ways is because people get focused on adding fun, and that gamification was about these high-level, easy things to plop on top of a PowerPoint,” she says.

“The best video games are hard; an easy video game is not fun. You want that challenge. A good math problem will grab you and take you, and it hurts your brain almost, but you like it because that struggle is meaningful and hard.”

Sebastian Krook, Senior Learning Designer at UTS, says universities are well placed to provide corporate training and upskilling as they are authentically learning organisations.

“It’s a legitimate space to be nerdy, to immerse yourself in something that has nothing to do with corporate objectives or participating in a cultural initiative. You eliminate the cynicism you can find in L&D initiatives by working with the university that way,” he says.

“We collaborate with the industry partner who has the experience, we’ve got the academic and research experience – we bring these two things together to make training incredibly specific.”

US boosts the largest and most competitive master's courses in Instructional Design in the world.
